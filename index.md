<meta property="og:description" content="Inside-outside determination is a basic building block for higher-level geometry
processing operations.  Generalized winding numbers provide a robust answer for
triangle meshes, regardless of defects such as self-intersections, holes or
degeneracies.  In this paper, we further generalize the winding number to point
clouds.  Previous methods for evaluating the winding number are slow for
completely disconnected surfaces, such as triangle soups or--in the extreme
case-- point clouds.  We propose a tree-based algorithm to reduce the asymptotic
complexity of generalized winding number computation, while closely
approximating the exact value.  Armed with a fast evaluation, we demonstrate the
winding number in a variety of new applications: voxelization, signing
distances, generating 3D printer paths, defect-tolerant mesh booleans and point
set surfaces." />
